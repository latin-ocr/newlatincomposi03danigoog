73. chaps. 5-7. 1. The proposal of Gaius Caesar is
¹that of one [who is] consulting for the safety of the
people, and is, as it were, a hostage for² his perpetual
good-will towards the state. No one can doubt ³what he
thinks about the whole case who voted a reward· to the
informer and thanks to the investigator3 and who,
[though] a very mild and gentle person, consigns Len·
tulus to perpetual darkness and chains.

2. Wherefore‚ if' you adopt the proposal of Silanus,I
shall not sear· the charge of cruelty, for what oruelty can
there be ⁴in 'punishing with death a man who isin no
sense⁵ a citizen, but is an enemy of the republic? The
proposer of the Sempronian law⁸ himself was put to
death by command of the people.

3. When I see· lin my mind's eye the city falling
in tuin, the 'wretched heaps of unburied citizens, and
Cethegus revelling in your blood, Ι cannot think⁸ about
merny and compassion towards the guilty [wretches]
who have wished to murder· us and to set up the race
of the Allobroges on the ruins⁹ of the city.

4. Anu· now, lest some one may 1⁰be apprehensive
llthat there is not help· enough ¹²t0 carry out ¹³the
measures that you 1⁴decide upon today‚ [Ι will say
that] every preparation has been made. The Roman
