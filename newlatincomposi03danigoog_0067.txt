105. ehaps. 16-20. 1. ¹When Caesar observed that the
AEduans were not collecting the grain which they had
promised? and that there was not a sufficient³ store of
provender for his army, he summoned' their leading men,
aud complained because at sc critical a time they had
not relieved⁴ him.

2. Liscus had no doubt that the magistrates themselves
by violent 'harangues⁵ prevented tho common pecple
⁶from using¹ the grain which had been collected.

3. Caesar ³asked many questions of Liscus and others3
he found [it] to be true that Dumnorix vas ”in great
favor rvith the common people; that his wife was a
Helvetian‚ and that his sister l⁰had been given in mar-
riage tc a Helvetian3 [and] that he commanded the
cavalry which startedll the flight in an unsuccessful
skirmish ¹²that happened ¹³a few days before.

4. When all these things had been done 1⁴with0ut
Caesar's knowledge, he thought there was sufficient
reason 1⁵why he should summon¹ Divitiacus to him and
urge him ¹⁶to take measures concerning Dumnorix.

5. Divitiacus l⁷was much pained at this, and begged·
Oaesar l⁸nct tc pass too severe a sentence upon his
brother. Moved by his entreatieS, he summoned Dum-
norix, told him ¹⁹what fault he found in him, and advised
him 2⁰to avoid all grounds of suspicion in future.
