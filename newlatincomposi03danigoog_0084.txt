70 omens: saturo wne, Book 111.

122. Ghaps. 23-29. 1. The Aquitanicus, thinking· that
they could easily drire the Romans from their bounda·
ries, if all the states shohld conspire1 and gather¹ troops,
send ambassadors in all directions. Reinforcements are
summoned even from Hither Spain. Leaders are selected
from the old‘ troops of Quintus Sertorius, who understood·
the Roman way² of carrying on war, and the number of
the enemy increases' day by day.

2. When these facts were reported to Crassus, he
determined⁸ to make an attaok upon the enemy's camp
the next day. At daybreak the soldiers begam· some to
fill the trenches and others to hurl weapons upon the
rampart. The enemy fought steadily and fearlessly.⁸

3. At length some horsemen, ⁴who had made 3 circuit
of the camp, reported to Crassus that ⁵there was an easy
way of aceess to the camp ⁰in the rear. A few cohorts
were quiekly led around the camp⁷ by a long route, ⁸so
that they might not be seen by the enemy, and having
broken down the wall, they halted right⁹ in the enemy’s
camp before these knew ¹⁰what the matter was.

4. Thus, surrounded on all sides, the enemy Ilgave up
all hope and sought safety in flight. Our cavalry pur-
sued them through the open platus, and returned to camp
late at night.
