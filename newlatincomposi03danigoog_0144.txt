ARCHIAS.

75. chapa.1-5. 1. Aulus Licinius Archias was born
1of a noble· family at Antioch, a city² once populous and
wealthy, and abounding in men ³0f the highest learning.
4In boyhood he was trained in polite learning, and after-
wards, ⁵having devoted himself to writing, he was
thought worthy of the acquaintance and hospitality of
many persons both in Italy and Graece.

2. When he had come to Rome, 6while still a young
man, he ⁷became acquainted with many distinguished·
men. Not only ⁸was his acquaintance cultivated by
those who could furnish him with the noblest⁹ subjects
1⁰for his pen, but also by those who were eager to listen
to him.

3. Although he had had a domicile in Rome for many
years, and afterwards had been enrolled as a citizen at
Heraclea, a city¹l having the most favorable privileges
and treaty-rights, he was accused by a certain¹² Gratius,
under the Papian Law, ¹³on the ground that he was not a
Roman citizen.

4. Cicero pleaded the cause of his friend before the
court, and easily proved by the evidence of Lucullus and
of the Heraclean deputies that Archias was a Roman
citizen under the law of Silvanus aud Carbo. A large
part of his oration is devoted¹4 to celebrating the praises
cf literature.
