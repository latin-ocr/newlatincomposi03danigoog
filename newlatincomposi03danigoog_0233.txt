This Series will contain the Latin authors usually read in Amen·
ean schooIs and collegas, and also others well adapted to class-roem
nse, but not as yet published in suitable editions. The several
volumes will be prepared by special editors, who will aim to revise
the text earelully and to edit it in the most serviceable manner.
Where there are German editions oi unusual merit, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these will be used, with the consent oi the foreign editor, as a basis
ior the American edition. In this way it will be possible to bring
out text-books oi the highest excellence in a comparatively short
period oi time.

The editions will be oi two kinds, conforming to the different
methods of studying Latin in our best institutions. Some will
eontain in the introductions and commentary such a carenni and
minute treatment ol the author’s lite, langnage, and style as to
afford the means ior a thorough appreciation of the author and his
place in Latin literature. Others will aim merely to assist the
student to a good reading knowledge ol the author, and will have
only the text aud briei explanatory notes at the bottom of each
page. The latter will be particularly acceptable lor sight reading,
and ior rapid reading aiter the minute study of an author or period
in one oi the fuller editions. For instance, aiter a class has read
a play or two oi Plautus and Terence careiully, with special refer·
ence to the peculiarities ol style, language, metres, the methods
oi presenting a play, and the like, these editions will be admirably
suited for the rapid reading oi other plays.

The Series will also contain various supplementary works pre-
pared by competent scholars. Every effort will be made to give
the books a neat and attractive appearance.
