OATILINE IV.

72. cnape. 1-4. 1. Consoript fathers, you know that
lI arn never free from the danger of death either in the
Forum or in the Senatehouse‚ or ²in my own home,
or even in this seat of hon0r3 but yet, whatever fate
awaits³ me, I shall endure it with equanimity,⁴ provided -

that by my efforts safety is seoured to you and to the
Roman people.

2. For why should I not rejoioe to have ‘resoued you,
your wives and your' children from slaughter, and the
Vestal virgins from hitter outrage, even if the immortnl
gods should will thar Ι arn to suffer· all paine and hard-
ships, and even death itself?

3. Yesterday I asked “for your judgment about the
fact, and ⁷f0r your deoision about the penalty. Today,
before night, we must deride· what ⁸is to hedone about
the aooused. For this mischief, whioh has spread fur-
ther ⁹than is generally supposed, ean by no means be
oheoked by ¹⁰i0rbearauoe and procrastination.

4. llIt is the opinion of Decimus Silanus that the oon-
spirators should be punished' with death, while¹² Gaius
Caesar holds¹³ that death was not appointed by the gods
as¹⁴a punishment, but as orest from¹⁵ toil and misery3
and therefore he recommends6 confiscation of property
and imprisonment ¹⁷f0r life.
