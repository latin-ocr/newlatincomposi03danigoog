124. chaps. 7-13. 1. The Germana said that they had
corne lon the invitation of the Gauls, but that they would
be friendly to Caesar ‘tf he would allow· them tc retain
the lands ³which they had taken in war3 nevertheless, if
the Roman people should provoke them, and make war
upon them, ⁴they would resist and ask for no quarter.

2. Caesar replied ⁵that there were no vacant lands in
Gaul which so great a multitude could settle in, but that
he would order⁶ the Ubii to allow⁰ them to settle in their
territorias. Caesar ⁷kcpt drawing nearer to the campos
the Germana, and they ⁷kept sending ambassadors to him,
⁸for the purpose, as he thought, of causing'delay until⁹
their cavalry, which was away, should return. ⁵

3. However, before¹⁰ these did return, about eight hun-
dred horsemen, who were near, made an attack upon
Caesar’s horsernen, and l¹threw them into disorder. ¹²As
soon as they rallied, the Germans dismounted, and, stab-
bing our horsea underneath13 and throwing down very
many of our men, put the rest to flight.

4. After this battle was fought, Caesar, thinking it to
be 1‘the height of folly to accept any terms from men¹⁵
who through treachery and deceit, ¹⁶after suing for peace,
had made war 1⁷without provocation‚ determined' to give
battle on the next day.
