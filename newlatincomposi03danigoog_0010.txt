ment of this index. Here is a fairly complete alphabetical list
of the principal rules oi syntair, with references to four promi·
nent grannnars. The numbers at the left margin enable the
pupil to find easily the references from the exercises. Here
also will be found back references to the exercises where the
several rules are specially treated.

Some teachers, sor lach of time, may be obliged to omit a
portion of the exercises. This can be done best, without
affecting the character of the training, by confining the work to
Parte I. and IL, or by using only alternate or selected sentences
in eaoh'of the tliree parts. The amount of practice which the

whole book offers is merely what the best interests of the pupil
demand, and is not more than some colleges expect for entrance.
An attempt hasbeen made to prepare more than the usual
amount of material ior composition, but so easy and so well
graded that it will not take more of tlre pupil’s time and energy
than other books of much more limited range.

To Prof. Ε. Μ. Pease‚ editor-inchief of The Students’ Series, ·
Iam indebted for much wise counsel and valuable aid, which
he has given from time to time during the whole progress oi

the revision.
