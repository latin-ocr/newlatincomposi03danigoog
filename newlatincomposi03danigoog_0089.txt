127. chaps. 24-30. 1. The difficulty of landing¹ was
very great, because the enemy were on the beach‚ and

When Caesar observed that his men did not fight ⁴with
their usual alacrity, he ordered the galleys to be drawn
up near the exposed flank of the enemy, and⁸ weapons
to be hurled ⁶fr0m them against the enemy.

. 2. This manoeuvre⁶ was ⁷of great use to our men, for
the shape of the vessels and the nature of our artillery⁸

not follow them far because they had no cavalry.

ships were disabled by the storm and by the high
tides,
