that the Suevi intended to await his arrival in a place
1which they had selected in ⁹about the centrc of those
regions which they held. However‚ having accomplished
cverything³ for the sake⁸ of which he had orossed the
Rhine‚ he did not pursue them, but withdrew into Gaul
and brohe up the bridge.

2. Although⁴ Caesar knew⁰ nothing about Britain except⁵
that auxiliaries were furnished to his enemies from that
island, still he decided' to proceed there6 in order to ex-
amine into the character of the people, and to reconnoitre
the har-bors and approaches.

3. But ⁷since he could not learn from traders either
what the sire of the island was or what the habits of

the people were, or what harbors there were, 8before¹

making the attempt 9in person, he directed Gaius Volu-
senus l⁰to make a thorough investigation. Meanwhile,
when about eighty transports had been collected, he
ordered the soldiers to go on board, and immediately· set
sail.

4. He reached Britain in about ten honre, and⁵ there
saw the forces of the enemy marshalled ¹¹under arms on
the cliffs, which iu that place are very ¹⁴·'near the shore.
13Νοπ wishing ¹⁴to land there, he procceded seven miles

further‘‚¹⁵ and stationed the fleet ¹⁶off an open and level
beach.
