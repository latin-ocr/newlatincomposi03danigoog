115. ctiaps. 18-23. 1. The Nerviihad selected asaplace¹
for their camp a hill wooded iu² the uppcr part, within
which woods they kept themselves hidden³3 and when
they saw the first ⁴part of our baggagetrain, ⁵which was
the time agreed upon ⁶f0r making an attach upon the
cavalry, they suddenly· rushed forth from the woods ⁷in
full force.

2. In the ⁸battle' with the Nervii, which ltook place
between two hills, the Roman soldiers were much embar-
rassed on account· of the 1⁰quick movements of the enemy.
Many of ¹¹the former were busy¹² ¹³fortifying the camp,
and not a few were a 1⁴considerable distance away sceh-
ing materials.¹⁵ Caesar, however, urged thern ¹⁶to remem-
ber their former valor and bravely sustaiu the cnemy’s
charge.

3. The army⁸ could not be formed as the methods of
military science¹⁷ required, because the character of the
ground was suoh¹⁸ that the view was obstructed by
hedges, and regular¹⁹ reserves could not be posted, nor
could Oaesar alone give²⁰ all the [necessary] orders. '
2¹After the Atrebates had been driven into the river, our
meu slew⁸ with their swords a large part of them ²²as
they attempted· to cross.
