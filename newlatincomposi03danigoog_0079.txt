117. chaps. 29—35. 1. The Aduatuci, who had corne ¹to
help· the Nervii, when they heard of this battle· went
home again and withdrew into one town, which had high
precipioes ²all around. Oaeser constructed at a distance
from the town a high tower, which the townsmen³
thought· the Romans, [being] men of so little stature,
could not move. ’

2. Bur when it 4began to approach the town, they were
so alarmed that they sent ambassadors to Caesar, who
spoke ⁵after this fashion: “they had not thought· that
the Romans could move machines of so great wcight3
they yielded⁷ to his power⁸3 one thing they begged‚'-
⁸that ⁹he would show his customary kindness and spere
them.” Caesar replied that he would spere them, ¹⁰if
they should surrender before throwing their arms· into
the ditch.

3. The townsmen ¹¹as a last resort suddenly· made a

sortie from the town in the night. Our men quichly
¹²made signals by sires, and all from the nearest redonbts
ran ¹³to the spot where the enemy had gone, slew three
thousand men, and drove the rest· into the town.

4. At the same time Crassus informed Caesar that he

had reduced all the states that border on the ocean into
the power of the Roman people. After all these achieve-
ments, Oaesar hastened to Italy.
