Render into Latin the following passage : - ἢ

The Helvetians, whether that they thought the Romans
were retiring because they were afraid, or that they
trusted to be able to out them off from their supplies
altered their plan, and, changing their line of march,
began to follow up and harass our men on the rear.
When Caesar perceived this, he withdrew his forces to
the nearest hill, and sent the cavalry to sustain the onset
of the enemy. He himself meanwhile drew up four vet-
eran legions in triple line midway up the hill. On the
erest of the hill he ordered the two legions lately levied
in hither Gaul and all the auxiliarios to be stationed, the
soldiers' packs to be brought together into one place, and
that place to be defended by those who occupied the
upper line.

(Ei legationi Ariovistus respondit) :-

Si quid ipsi a Caesare opus esset, sese adeum venturum
fuisse; siquid ille se velit, illum ad se venire oportere.
Praeterea se neque sine exercitu in caspartes Galliae
venire audere, quas Caesar possideret, neque exercitum
sine magno commeatu atque molimento in unum locum
contrahere posse.
