121. chaps. 18-22. 1. ¹By means of a suitable person,
who went over to the enemy's ,camp as a desertor, Sabi-
nus confirmed the impression² of his cowardice, and 3gave
the enemy to understand that he was ⁴g0ing to withdraw
his army seoretly from camp, and escape ⁵if he could.

2. ⁶When they heard that, they all exclaimed that they
must proceed to Sabinus's camp, ⁸and thither they has·
tened with such speed that they got there ”quite out oi
breath; and ¹⁰owing to their iatigue, they were llunable
to bear even our first charge.

3. A new war now arose in Aquitania-which, as has
been said, is a third part of Gaul, -whither Crassus had
been sent tc lead an army against the Sontiates

4. ¹²A long and fierce battle was fought, because¹³ the
Sentiates, relying upon former victories,¹⁴ thought⁸ that
the saiety of Aquitania lay¹⁵ in their valor, while¹⁶ the
Romans desired⁸ to show¹⁷ what they could accomplish
without their general. CrassuS, having slain a large
number, attached¹ their town, and many surrendered.
While¹8 they were delivering their arms, Adiatunnus
made a sortie from another part oi the town, but was

driven back.
