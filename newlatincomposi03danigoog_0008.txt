Onna Exnncmas. - The sentences for oral translation have
been materially simplified, and special attention has been paid
to idionis and phrases that occur in the text. These exercises,
based on the text ol the Latin authors, are so simple and so
well graded as to draw lightly upon the pnpil's time, while they
afford a large amount oi practice in composition, and insure a
thorough acquaintance with the Latin text, its vocabularyâ€š
construotions, and idioma, and, more than that, lurnish the
best oi training informs. lt is believed that the teacher who
insists upon the rapid oral translation of these exercises in
connection with the daily review will find that his pupils will
soon acquire a happy facility in translation and aready acquaint-
ance with forms.

An important change will be found also in the arrangement
of these oral exercises, designed to aid in a thorough and defi-
nite acquaintance with the principles of syntax. In each
exercise emphatic attention has been given to one or two

selected rules of syntax, instances oi which occur in the text
upon which it is based. In nearly every case these rules
are applied in the exercisc in three or more sentences, and other
applications appear iu succeeding exercises. The references to
the Grammatical Index will lead the pupil to the rules and
further illustrations of thern in his Grammar. It is strongly
recornmended that the pupil commit to memory at least one
illustration of every rule learned, to make still more effective
this thorough special drill. Experience shows that after a little
practice these oral exercises require very little time in prepara
tion and but little ol the recitation period, and they render
unnecessary many questions on form and syntax. The five or
ten minutes of each recitation, therefore, spent in this oral
work are in no sense lost. It must not be lorgotten that this
kind of practice, even if it did not look forward to Latin com-
position as an end, is very useful, not to say necessary, in
bringing the pupil to a better understanding ol his Latin
text. The teacher will notice that the exercises are so graded
