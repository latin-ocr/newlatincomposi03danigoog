67. 0111166. 6-9. 1. Β111 there are some who 6611
lwhether I drove Catiline into exile or not. How² can
it be said that Ι drove him into exile, when³ all the
senators know· that 116 has entered upon war, that he
has sent to the camp ⁴of Manlius arms 61111 military
standards, and even his silver eagle? [These] who

man, and I a most cruel tyrant, 11161 banish men by
threats and 16166, 616 attempting to 161666 6 storm 01
odium against me.

Catiline has gone into exile at⁸ Massilia, say 11 he should
