119. chaps. 7-12. 1. A new war arose in Gaul, ¹the ⁴

cause of which was that the Veneti, who lived· cn the
seacoast, had detained two Roman ambassadors, think-
ing² that through them they should recover ³tl1eir own
hostageS, whom Crassus held⁴ They induced their
, neighbors to detaiu two other· ambassadors, and to do
nothing without⁵ the general consent.

2. ⁶Owing to the nature of their position, and to their
knowledge of naval affairs, they trusted that the Romans,
⁷who neither had any supply⁸of ships nor were acquainted'
with the places where the war· ⁹would have to be carried
on, would give up the hostages and depart from those
regions.

3. Althcugh¹⁰ Caesar was aware' of the difficulties of
waging war in places where towns were situated¹l cn

⁸ extreme points of laud and afforded¹² no aceess to an

army except by ships, nevertheless, ¹³the wrong done by
detaining hostages, the conspiring of so many states, and
especially· l‘the fear that other⁸ states might conspire

which had not yet conspired with the Veneti, and imme-

diately· ordered ships to be built and supplies to be
brought together.
