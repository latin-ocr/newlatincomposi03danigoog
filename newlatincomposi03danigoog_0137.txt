68. ehaps. 10—13. 1. Since this is so', fellowcitizenS,
I have so managed affairs that, even if Catilina should
make raids upon the colonies and free-towns, they can
easily be defended. Finally,1 cannot forget that those
whom Catiline has left· in the city are our enemies, ¹and

that they should be warned again and again hot to
³make any stir in the city.

2. To these men Ι say, “⁴Be assurcd that the consuls
are vigilant, that they have provided a sufficient guard⁸

for the city, [and] that the citizens have been warned to
defend their homes with sentinels and guarda. If you
make the slightest attempt against your country, I shall
immediately discover it.''

3. We are supplied with everything³ that⁶ Catiline
lachs'. On one side are your consuls and generals, on
the other, that wornout and wounded gladiator; on one
side the flovver and strength· of all Italy, on the other, a
gang of shameless and indecent profligates3 on this side
the citios of your colonists, on that, the wooded heights
of Catiline.

. 4. In a contest of this kind, who can doubt that⁷ the
immortal gods will defend 8in person this fair city
against the impious attacks of unprincipled men? Do
you,⁹ then, fellowcitizens, enter upon this war, relying
not on human devices‚¹⁰ but on the gods themselves. -
llUnder my guidance no good man shall perish, but all

ι villany shall be crushed.
