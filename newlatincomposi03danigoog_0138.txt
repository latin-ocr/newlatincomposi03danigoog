OATILINE III.

69. cbaps. 1-5. 1. Fellowcitizens,1 the republic is
safe'. Your wives, your children'‚ and your homes· have,
through my efforts, been rescuedl from fire⁸ and sword‚
and restored² to you. And, because³ I know· that you
are waiting ⁴t0 learn· ⁵what has taken place since Catiline
“a few days ago burst out of the city, 1 will lay· before
you the whole matter.

2. The leaders who remained in the city ⁷tried to tam-
per with the ambassadors from Gaul, and, as⁸ they were
about to return to Gaul, gave them a letter 0f⁹ instruc-
tions for Catiline.

3. When¹⁰I found· out that they were ¹¹laying this plot,
I saw that the opportunity was offered me ¹²0f getting
such agrasp of the whole conspiracy that both you and
the senate might clearly comprehend1³ it. Therefore the
Allobroges and Volturcius were arrested and brought
back to the city.

4. Although l*it was the opinion of many distinguished
men L‘that I should open the letters before submitting¹⁶
them to the senate, I kept the seals unbroken. After
Volturcius had disclosed· what¹⁷ he knew,¹⁸ and the Gauls
had given their evidence, the documents were brought
forward.
