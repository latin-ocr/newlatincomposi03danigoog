77. chapr. 10-12. 1. Alexander the Great had with
him many historiens of his exploitS, for he knew that, ¹if
hc had no oue ²to be the herald of his valor, his name
8would be buried iu the same tomb that ⁴sh0uld cover
his body. And so ou'r own “Magnus'' awarded a prize
to the historian of his achievcments, Theophanes of
Mytilene.

2. Sulla bestowed citizenship upon many Spaniards3
and would he have rejected Archias, ⁵if he had sought
[his favor]? He who was so⁶ eager ⁷to have his actions
celebrated in verse that he lent an car to the poor poets
of Cordowa would not, Ι suppose, have sought⁸ for the
genius of Archias.

3. It must be admitted· that even⁹ those philosophers
who write treatises ¹⁰on the contempt of glory are them-
selues,⁰ uevertheless, influenced hythe love of praise3
andin fact, l¹the best meu are most attracted by glory.
Ido not hesitate to confess· to you that Ι myself³ desire
no other reward· for my toils and dangers in your behali
than the eternal¹ heralding oi my virtues

4, Wherefore, since Archias has ¹²d0ue honor iu his
verse to the aohievements of the Roman people, and
since he is ¹³possessed of such a genius that he is courted
by our most distinguished· men, I entreat¹⁴ you, gentle-
men of the jury, ²to receive him under your protection,
so that he may seem to be relieved by your humanity
rather than injured by your severity.
