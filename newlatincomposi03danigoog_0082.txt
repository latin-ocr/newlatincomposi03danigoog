120. chaps. 13-1'7. 1. The Gallie ships were of so great
solidityl that ²they could not be injured by the beaks of
our ships3 and their height was so great ¹that weapons⁸
could not easily be ³thr0wn to them with effect. Because
of their height, too, the weapons sent by the enemy fell
more heuvily upon our men. ’

2. NeverthelesS‚ by means of sharpened hooks attached
t0 long poles, the ropes which fastened the yards to the
masts were eut off, and the yards fell; and thus ⁴the sails
became useless. Theu our men ⁵would board the ship,
and by their superior valor overpower⁸ the barbarians.
The latter, sinoe they could find⁸ no remedy for this
“mode of attauh, hastened to fiee, but ⁷a oahn suddenly·
oame on so that they oould not stir⁸ from the spot.

3. Almost⁹ all the ships were tahen³ by the Romans3 '

while¹⁰ the Veneti, having lost their ships, llhad no means Ι
of defending their townS, and so were compelled to surren-
der to Caesar, who deoided' that 1²they must be punished¹
¹³with the utmost severity.

4. While these things were going on, Viridovix 14ool-
leeted a large army of desperate men from all parts of
Gaul, and ¹⁵0ffered battle to Quintus Titurius Sabinus,

Caesar's lieutenant; but he kept himself in camp, ¹⁶be-
cause the commender-inohief was absent.
