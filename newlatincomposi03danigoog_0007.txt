Γ111100οο1110010110101101 the author’s “Ε110101000 111 Latin
Prose Composition,” with certain important additions which
have been suggested by his own experiencc and that 01 many
01 his fellow teachers. The former work was prepared “ in the
belief that Latin composition can best be taught directly in
connection with the reading 01 the Latin authors. Its purpose
is to 1111111011 pupils with sufficient material 101 0101 and written

. practice in Latin composition while reading Caesar and Cicero.

Its method contemplatos the study and recitation 01 the oral
exercises as a part 01 each day's lesson, either 111 the advance or
the daily review (preferably the latter), and 01 the written exer-
cises at stated periods corresponding to the progress 01 the class
in the Latin text, - the important thing being to have both oral
and written work done while the passages on which they 010
based are fresh in the mind. The text thus 1111111011θο the
vocabulary, the models 101 all the idioms, the principles 01
syntax, and the order and arrangement 011101·110.”

His own later experience, the verdict 01 0 multitude 01 his
fellow teachers, the attitude 01 the universities and colleges 01
highest rank, the reports 01 1110 10110110 Latin conferenceS, as
well as the recent fiattering imitations 01 his textbook, afford
ι a very convincing endorsement 01 this purpose and method.
It is confidently expected, however, that the changes and ad·
ditioris that have been made 111 this revision will render the

work still more effective.
