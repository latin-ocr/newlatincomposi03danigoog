BOOK III.

118. chaps. 1-6. 1. ¹When Galba had been sent towards
the Alpe, he had permission, ²if he thought· it necessary,¹
³to go into winter quarters in a valley 4which lay near the
river. In this⁵ valley there was a village.

2. The Gauls who lived· there, despising⁰ Galba’s legion,
⁷because two cohorte had been detached to procure sup
plies, and thinking⁶ that the rest' of the legion could not
withstand an attach, departed froin the village by night,
and ⁸took position on the mountain, lwhence they might
charge down into the valley and easily overpower⁸ the
whole' legion. Galba quickly called a coun0i1·10f0r the
purpose of getting¹¹ the opinions· of his officers.

3. ¹²A majority decided to stay where they were and
defend the camp. At a given signal the enemy began· to
hurl stenes and javelins upon the rampart. Our men at·
first ¹³made a brave resistance, but¹ on account· of their
14small number were unable to leave· the fight L⁵to rest
themselves.

4. At last ¹⁶matters came to such a pass that Galba
directed his men to try· the last resource, 1⁷make a sortie
from all the gates, and leave· the enemy no chance ¹⁸to
collect their wits.
