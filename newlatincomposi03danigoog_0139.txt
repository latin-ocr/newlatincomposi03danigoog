5. Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, [each] identified his
hand and 0001. The letters were read. Lentulus, 1⁹011
being asked' by the Gauls whether he had 2⁰n0t said
something tou them about firing the city, though at first¹
110 denied his guilt, a while afterwards confessed⁸ it.

⁷0. cuaps. 6-11 1. After the evidence had all been set
forth, the senate ¹passed a decree against nine 0f² the
conspirators, that they should be 3put under guard, and,
⁴because Lentulus was a praetor, it was decided' that he
should first⁸ resign his office, so that there might be no
“scruples to prevent his being punished⁸.

driven Catilina from 1110 city. And· also 1110 0011010
decreed 0 thanksgiving 101110 immortal gods in my name,
because I had not only managed the 70110110 01 01010 suo·
cessfully, but had even saved the state.

l²it does not belong to human wisdom to have foreseen
all that has happened· in our consulship.
